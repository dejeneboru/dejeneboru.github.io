I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Karlstad University, Sweden. My Ph.D. research focuses on improving quality of service (QoS) in Computer Networks. Particularly, I am working on the design of latency-aware multipath transport protcols for next generation networks (5G). My research interest are in the areas of Networking, Transport Protocols, Virtualization, Cloud Computing, NFV, and Network optimization.
